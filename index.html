                    <p>It will be most interesting to watch the gradual convergence of the two brightest planets, Venus and Jupiter, all through the month of February.
                        On Feb. 1, both planets are evident in the west-southwest sky. If you hold your clenched fist out at arm's length, the two worlds are separated by three fists. But by Feb. 28, they'll be separated by the width of two full moons.

                    <p>Mercury, the innermost planet to the sun, is often referred to as the "elusive planet" because of its close proximity to the sun. But during this three-week interval, the  rocky little world will be very favorably placed to see in the evening sky.</p>
